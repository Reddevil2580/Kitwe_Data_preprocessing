Objective:
The primary goal of the code is to categorize news descriptions into specific categories using a keyword-based approach. The categories are defined in advance, and keywords associated with each category help determine the correct classification for each news description.

Logic:
Keyword Matching:

A dictionary (categories_keywords) is created, where each category (e.g., sports, politics, education) is associated with a list of relevant keywords.
Each news description is scanned to check if it contains any keywords linked to one or more categories.
If a keyword matches, the description is tagged with the corresponding category.
Implementation:

The code is implemented in Python using the Pandas library for data manipulation.
The categorize_description function is created to handle the keyword-matching logic:
It takes a news description as input.
Iterates over each category and its associated keywords.
If a keyword is found in the description, the category is added to a list.
If multiple categories match, they are combined; if none match, itâ€™s marked as "uncategorized."
This function is applied to each row in the Description column of the dataset.
Output:
The result is a categorization of each news description based on the presence of keywords.
Each description is tagged with one or more categories, or marked as "uncategorized" if no keywords match.
The output is typically a modified dataset where each description has a new category label, facilitating further analysis or visualization.
The approach uses a rule-based method (keywords) to handle multi-category classification, relying solely on the predefined keyword lists to determine the output.
