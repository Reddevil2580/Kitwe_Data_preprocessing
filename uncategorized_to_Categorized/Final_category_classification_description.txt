Objective:
The primary goal of this notebook is to categorize previously uncategorized news descriptions by leveraging a machine learning model, specifically the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. This step is applied after a keyword-based categorization process left some descriptions without an assigned category.

Logic:
Handling Uncategorized Data:

The initial keyword-based approach might leave some descriptions labeled as "uncategorized."
To handle these uncategorized cases, a supervised machine learning approach is applied using the data that already has a categorized label.
Implementation:

Data Preparation:
The dataset is split into two parts:
Categorized Data: Rows that have a defined Single_Category label.
Uncategorized Data: Rows where the category is still "uncategorized."
The Description is used as the feature, while Single_Category serves as the label for the training data.
Text Vectorization:
A TF-IDF Vectorizer is applied to convert the text descriptions into numerical feature vectors.
This transformation allows the KNN algorithm to work with the textual data.
KNN Classification:
A K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier is trained using the categorized data.
The trained model is then used to predict the categories for the previously uncategorized rows.
Category Assignment:
The predicted categories are assigned back to the previously uncategorized rows, effectively filling in the missing categories.
Output:

The output is a fully categorized dataset where the previously "uncategorized" entries are now assigned specific categories based on the KNN prediction.
The final dataset is saved, ensuring no descriptions remain unclassified unless the KNN prediction fails for some entries.
Additionally, a count of any remaining "uncategorized" rows is checked after prediction.
This notebook integrates a machine learning approach (KNN) to complement the initial keyword-based categorization, filling in gaps left by the rule-based method to ensure a comprehensive categorization of all descriptions.
